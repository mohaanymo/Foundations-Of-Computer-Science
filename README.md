# Learning journey of core computer science subjects

Hello, I am an undergraduate CS student who's trying to really understand the foundations of CS and dive deep on how things are actually work under the hood, I hope after few months of this I would get a good job.

This repo would cover all my activity from resources, my explanation, solved problems, projects, etc...
