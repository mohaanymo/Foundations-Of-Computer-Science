# What is Discrete Mathematics?

Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics that deals with **countable, separate, or distinct things**, rather than continuous things like curves or real numbers. Think of it as math for **things you can list, count, or separate**, like numbers, objects, or logical statements.
